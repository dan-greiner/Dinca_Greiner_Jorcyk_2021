This is a repository for the research publication: "Novel mechanism for OSM-promoted extracellular matrix remodeling in breast cancer: LOXL2 upregulation and subsequent ECM alignment (Simion Dinca, Daniel Greiner, Cheryl Jorcyk et al.).  PMID: 34011405.

The code is specifically for the analysis of data generated by the TCGA research network (www.cancere.gov/tcga). Data was downloaded through the Broad GDAC Firehose repository (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org). The specific data sets used were from breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), gliobastoma multiforme (GBM), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and ovarian cancer (OV).

In brief, using python, RSEM count data was standardized to Z-score for comparison and outlier patients above and below 3 standard deviations were removed from the dataset. Genes were then plotted, and correlation was assessed by Pearson coefficient using the SciPy package [57]. The line of best fit was determined by linear regression using the Polyfit function in the SciPy package.
